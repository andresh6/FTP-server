# Agile Class FTP Server

## Description
"The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may 
authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is 
configured to allow it." - Wikipedia

Our server will take a text based protocol and translate those commands into actions for moving files from or to server.
